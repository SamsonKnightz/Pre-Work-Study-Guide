# Pre-Work-Study-Guide
This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Description

I created this study guide to help me through the course and to hone my skills by repition. This project will help me grow, in doing so I will have access to the steps I have taken in order to accomplish my tasks. I have learned the structure and basis knowledge of how github connects us developers and helps us track our projects from remote desktops.
